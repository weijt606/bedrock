# Search Checkpoints and Code

Use `entire search` to find prior checkpoints, commits, and sessions with hybrid (semantic + keyword) search, or `entire search --code` to search code content across repositories. Requires `entire login`. Never run `entire search` without `--json` — it opens an interactive TUI.

## Response Format

Begin the first response to this skill invocation with the line:

`Entire Search:`

followed by a blank line, then the content.

- Apply the header to the **first response of the invocation only.** Do not re-print it on follow-up turns within the same invocation (e.g. after the user answers a clarifying question).
- Do **not** include the header on error or early-exit responses (e.g. "Entire CLI not installed", "authentication required", "no matches"). The header's presence should signal that the skill ran and produced real output.

## When to Use

- The user asks things like "have we done this before?", "search past work", "find the previous implementation", or "look for checkpoints about X"
- You need prior context from another branch, repo, author, or recent time period
- You want likely matches first, then a deeper transcript read only for the best hit
- The user wants to find code across repositories they have access to, e.g. "where is X implemented?", "find usages of Y in our other repos" — use code search (`--code`)

Do not use this for the current active session. Use `session-handoff` for that. For searching files in the current working copy, prefer local tools (grep, ripgrep) over code search.

## Process

1. Run a focused search with compact JSON output:

```bash
entire search "<query>" --json --compact --limit 5
```

Each compact hit carries `id`, `type` (checkpoint, commit, session, repo, or pr), `repo`, `branch`, `author`, `date`, a truncated `title`, the matched `snippet`, `filesTouched`, and a relevance `score` — never the full prompt. Results are ranked by relevance; raise `--limit` (per page) or add `--page` (1-based) only when the first five have no good hit.

If the CLI rejects `--compact` as an unknown flag (versions before 0.10.0), drop it and keep `--limit 5` — without `--compact` each hit embeds its full prompt, so a default page can run tens of KB.

Add filters when the user already gave them or when the first search is too broad:

```bash
entire search "<query>" --json --compact --limit 5 --repo owner/name --branch branch-name --author "Name" --date week
```

- `--repo` takes multiple repos: repeat it or comma-separate (`--repo a --repo b`, `--repo a,b`)
- Inline filters also work in the query: `author:<name>`, `date:<week|month>`, `branch:<name>`, `repo:<owner/name>`, `repo:*`
- Results default to the current repository. To search all accessible repos, pass `--all-repos`, write `repo:*` inside the query string, or pass `--repo '*'` (quoted). `--repo repo:*` is invalid — inline tokens never go in flag values.

2. Review the top hits and summarize the likely candidates for the user. Do not dump raw JSON unless they ask for it. If a hit's `title`, `snippet`, and `filesTouched` already answer the question, answer directly — do not run `explain` unless the user asks for details or the top hits are ambiguous. Prefer checkpoint and commit hits; session hits are projections of the same checkpoints.

3. To drill into a hit, pass its `id` (checkpoint ID or commit SHA, auto-detected) to:

```bash
entire checkpoint explain <id> --no-pager
```

- Add `--full` to pull the checkpoint's entire session transcript; if `--full` fails, fall back to `--raw-transcript`
- For a checkpoint hit from another GitHub repo, add `--repo <owner/name>` — it needs the full checkpoint `id` from the hit and a checkpoint that has been pushed. If the flag is unknown (versions before 0.10.0) or explain finds nothing, do not retry — answer from the compact fields instead
- For a session hit on the current branch, bridge with `entire checkpoint explain --session <id>`, which lists that session's checkpoints; explain one of those
- repo and pr hits (and sessions or commits from other repos or branches) cannot be explained — summarize them from the compact fields alone

## Code Search

Add `--code` to search code content instead of checkpoints:

```bash
entire search "<query>" --code --json
```

Scope and refine with flags:

```bash
entire search "<query>" --code --json --repo owner/name --limit 20 --case-sensitive
```

- By default results are scoped to the current repository; add `--all-repos` (or `repo:*`) to search every repo the user can access, or list repos with `--repo`
- `--case-sensitive` only applies with `--code`
- `--limit` is the total result count for code search (not per page)
- `--author`, `--branch`, `--date`, `--page`, and `--compact` are checkpoint-search options — do not combine them with `--code`
- Present results as file paths with matching snippets; do not dump raw JSON unless asked

### Code Search Heuristics

- Search for distinctive tokens: function names, error strings, config keys — not natural-language descriptions
- Prefer exact identifiers over partial words; add `--case-sensitive` when the identifier casing matters (e.g. `HttpClient` vs `httpclient`)
- Scope with `--repo` when the user names a repo; otherwise start with the current repo and widen with `--all-repos` if nothing hits
- If a query is too broad, add a second distinctive term or increase specificity before raising `--limit`
- If code search fails or reports that some regions were skipped, treat results as incomplete: search locally checked-out repos with ripgrep/grep, or run a checkpoint search for prior work touching that code

## Search Heuristics

- Start with the user's domain terms, feature name, error text, file name, or ticket ID
- Prefer narrower searches before increasing `--limit`
- Add `--repo` or `repo:*` explicitly when repository scope matters
- If there are no useful hits, broaden in this order: remove branch filter, widen date, simplify query terms

## Failure Modes

- If search says authentication is required, tell the user to run `entire login`
- If search says it "cannot search this repo yet", the repo is not indexed or its owner has not enabled semantic search — report that instead of retrying
- If there are no matches, say that clearly and mention the filters or query terms you tried
- If the user really wants the current session, switch to `session-handoff` instead of searching checkpoints
